 Jerry is at UW Madison. Jerry went to the Sett to bowl. He 
did not hit any pins unfortunately. He came back the next day
to try again and hit 1 pin.
Since then, Jerry practiced  very hard everyday on bowling. A few months later,
he becomes the best bowling player in his friends and won the championship in 
UW bowling competition
Fast forward 50 years. My friends Walter, Donnie, and I, are living a happy life in the local bowling leauge.
One day my rug is destroyed and I get mixed up in a kidnapping.
Three of the kidnappers fought us and Donnie had a heart attack.
