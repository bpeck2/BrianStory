Jerry is at UW Madison. Jerry went to the Sett to bowl. He 
did not hit any pins unfortunately. He came back the next day
to try again and hit 1 pin.
Since then, Jerry practiced  very hard everyday on bowling. A few months later,
he becomes the best bowling player in his friends and won the championship in 
UW bowling competition.
